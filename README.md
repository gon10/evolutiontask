I wanted to make the pipe selectable, and for that reason this solution as performance limitations for the levels 5 and 6 due to large number of pipes.

I tought of adding a canvas element and then adding each pipe to it, but I was not sure if that would still solve performance issues if I wanted to make them selectable.

To launch the solution please run npm install and then npm start
