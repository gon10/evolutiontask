I wanted to make the pipe selectable, and for that reason this solution as performance limitations for the levels 5 and 6 due to large number of pipes. For the levels 5 and 6 we need to tell the position we want to rotate instead of just select the tile.

I tought of adding a canvas element and then adding each pipe to it, but I was not sure if that would solve performance issues if I wanted to make them selectable.

To launch the solution please run npm install and then npm start
